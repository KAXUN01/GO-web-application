# Go Web Application

I developed a simple web application using GO language. It uses the `net/http` package to serve HTTP requests.

## Running the server

To run the server, execute the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port 8080. You can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/home` in your web browser.
